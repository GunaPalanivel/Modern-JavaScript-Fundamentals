## Introduction

In JavaScript, **operators** are symbols that perform operations on operands (variables and values). They are essential for manipulating data, making decisions, and controlling the flow of programs. This guide focuses on three primary categories of operators:

1. **Comparison Operators**: Compare two values and return a boolean (`true` or `false`).
2. **Equality Operators**: Determine if two values are equal or not, considering type.
3. **Logical Operators**: Combine multiple boolean conditions to form complex logical statements.

Understanding these operators, their differences, and their appropriate use cases is crucial for writing clear and efficient JavaScript code.
