## Introduction

In JavaScript, **operators** are symbols that perform operations on operands (variables and values). They are essential for manipulating data, making decisions, and controlling the flow of programs. This guide focuses on three primary categories of operators:

1. **Comparison Operators**: Compare two values and return a boolean (`true` or `false`).
2. **Equality Operators**: Determine if two values are equal or not, considering type.
3. **Logical Operators**: Combine multiple boolean conditions to form complex logical statements.

Understanding these operators, their differences, and their appropriate use cases is crucial for writing clear and efficient JavaScript code.

## 1. Comparison Operators

Comparison operators evaluate two values and return a boolean result (`true` or `false`). They are fundamental in controlling the flow of a program using conditional statements like `if`, `else`, and loops.

### Equality Operators: Strict vs. Loose

JavaScript provides both **strict** and **loose** equality operators, each with distinct behaviors based on type coercion.

#### Strict Equality (`===`)

The **strict equality** operator (`===`) compares both the **value** and **type** of two operands without performing any type conversion (type coercion). This ensures precise comparisons and is generally recommended to avoid unexpected results.

##### Example:

```javascript
const a = 10;
const b = 20;

// Comparing values and types
console.log(a === b); // Output: false
console.log(typeof (a === b)); // Output: boolean

console.log(5 === 5); // Output: true
console.log(5 === "5"); // Output: false (Different types)
console.log(typeof (5 === "5")); // Output: boolean
```

- **Why Use It**: Ensures that both operands are identical in value and type, reducing bugs caused by implicit type conversions.
- **Under the Hood**: No type coercion occurs; both operands must be of the same type to return `true`.
