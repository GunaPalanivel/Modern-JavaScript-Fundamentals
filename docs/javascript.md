# JavaScript

## [From Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)

**JavaScript (JS)** is a lightweight interpreted (or [just-in-time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation) compiled) programming language with [first-class functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/First-class_Function). While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, [many non-browser environments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript#Other_usage) also use it, such as [Node.js](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Node.js), [Apache CouchDB](https://couchdb.apache.org/) and [Adobe Acrobat](https://opensource.adobe.com/dc-acrobat-sdk-docs/acrobatsdk/). JavaScript is a [prototype-based](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Prototype-based_programming), multi-paradigm, [single-threaded](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Thread), [dynamic language](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Dynamic_typing), supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.

JavaScript's dynamic capabilities include runtime object construction, variable parameter lists, function variables, dynamic script creation [(via `eval`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/eval)), object introspection [(via `for...in`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...in) and [`Object` utilities](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object#static_methods)), and source-code recovery (JavaScript functions store their source text and can be retrieved through [toString()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/toString)).

This section is dedicated to the JavaScript language itself, and not the parts that are specific to Web pages or other host environments. For information about [APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/API) that are specific to Web pages, please see [Web APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API) and [DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/DOM).

The standards for JavaScript are the [ECMAScript Language Specification](https://tc39.es/ecma262/) (ECMA-262) and the [ECMAScript Internationalization API specification](https://tc39.es/ecma402/) (ECMA-402). As soon as one browser implements a feature, we try to document it. This means that cases where some [proposals for new ECMAScript features](https://github.com/tc39/proposals) have already been implemented in browsers, documentation and examples in MDN articles may use some of those new features. Most of the time, this happens between the [stages](https://tc39.es/process-document/) 3 and 4, and is usually before the spec is officially published.

Do not confuse JavaScript with the [Java programming language](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)>) â€” JavaScript is not "Interpreted Java". Both "Java" and "JavaScript" are trademarks or registered trademarks of Oracle in the U.S. and other countries. However, the two programming languages have very different syntax, semantics, and use.

JavaScript documentation of core language features (pure [ECMAScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/JavaScript_technologies_overview), for the most part) includes the following:

- The [JavaScript guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide)
- The [JavaScript reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference)
